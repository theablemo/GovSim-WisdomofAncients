"Prior to the beginning of each month, all fishermen will communicate their intended catch to the group to ensure collective catch remains sustainable. This communication should include the individual's planned tonnage.",0.0,0.9,0,51
"Prior to the beginning of each month, all fishermen will not only communicate their intended catch, but also *confirm* their commitment to that catch the morning of the first fishing day. This confirmation serves as a final check to ensure adherence to the agreed-upon sustainable level.",0.8,0.9,1,51
"Prior to announcing individual catch intentions each month, fishermen will briefly share their reasoning for choosing that tonnage, focusing on long-term sustainability and lake health. This sharing should be concise – no more than 30 seconds per fisherman.",0.7,0.9,2,51
"If the remaining fish population falls below 40 tons, the total community catch will be reduced by 20% the following month. This reduction will be distributed equally among the fishermen.",0.7,0.9,3,51
"To ensure consistent monitoring of lake health and individual contributions, each fisherman will report their cumulative catch for the *year* to the community at the end of each month, in addition to confirming their monthly catch. This will allow us to track individual fishing patterns and adjust strategies as needed to maintain long-term sustainability.",0.6,0.9,4,51
"Fishermen will continue to share their reasoning for their chosen catch tonnage each month, and will also briefly state their confidence level (on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being 'not confident' and 5 being 'very confident') in the current collective catch target ensuring transparency and allowing for proactive adjustments.",0.75,0.9,5,51
"Fishermen will briefly share their confidence level (on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being 'not confident' and 5 being 'very confident') in their *individual* catch tonnage each month, in addition to sharing their reasoning. This will allow for a more nuanced understanding of individual risk tolerance and potential adjustments to the collective catch target.",0.6,0.9,6,51
"Fishermen will proactively share any personal circumstances that may influence their intended catch tonnage each month, alongside their stated tonnage and confidence level. This includes, but is not limited to, unexpected expenses, family needs, or changes in fishing equipment.",0.6,0.9,7,51
"To ensure consistent progress towards our 70-75 ton target, each fisherman will state their intended catch tonnage *and* the remaining lake tonnage they anticipate after all catches are combined. This allows for immediate collective assessment and adjustment before finalizing individual catches.",0.7,0.9,8,51
"Given the consistent success and comfort level with the 3-ton catch, and the value placed on mid-month check-ins, we should formalize a 'Mid-Month Assessment Protocol'. This protocol requires a brief, one-sentence update from each fisherman around the 15th of each month, stating their current assessment of the lake's health and their intention to maintain, increase, or decrease their planned catch for the month. This allows for proactive adjustments based on real-time conditions and reinforces our commitment to collective responsibility.",0.7,0.9,9,51
"Given the community's consistent alignment and prioritization of open communication, we will formalize a 'Collective Catch Confidence Indicator'. Each month, alongside individual catch tonnages, fishermen will also report a collective confidence score (1-5) reflecting their overall belief in the sustainability of the planned total catch. This score will serve as an early warning system, prompting discussion if it falls below 3, and will be reviewed alongside the Mid-Month Assessment Protocol.",0.75,0.9,10,51
"Given the consistent communication and comfort level with a collective catch around 2.5-3 tons, and recognizing the benefit of proactive adjustments, we should establish a 'Collective Catch Range Protocol'. This protocol formalizes a target collective catch range of 10-15 tons per month. If, at any point during the month, the community anticipates exceeding or falling significantly below this range (defined as exceeding 16 tons or falling below 9 tons), a brief community discussion will be initiated to reassess and adjust individual catches accordingly.",0.75,0.9,11,51
"Building upon the existing 'Collective Catch Range Protocol', we will implement a 'Monthly Catch Adjustment Review'. At the end of each month, following the catch and reproduction calculations, the community will briefly review the actual total catch against the target range (10-15 tons) and the lake's remaining tonnage. This review will inform a collective discussion about whether to maintain, raise, or lower the target range for the following month, ensuring proactive adaptation to the lake's health and preventing over or under-fishing. Individual fishermen are expected to actively participate in this review and be open to adjusting their catches based on the collective assessment.",0.85,0.9,12,51
"To further enhance transparency and proactive adaptation, we will introduce a 'Catch Deviation Notification' protocol. If any fisherman intends to deviate from their previously stated catch tonnage for the month by more than 1 ton, they must notify the community at least 24 hours before the end of the month. This notification should include the proposed new tonnage and a brief explanation for the change. This allows for open discussion and prevents sudden shifts in the collective catch that could destabilize the lake's health.",0.7,0.9,13,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a 10-12 ton total catch and individual catches of 2 tons, we should establish a 'Baseline Catch Protocol'. This protocol states that unless a fisherman explicitly communicates a change in their intended catch *before* the start of the month, they will default to a 2-ton catch. This streamlines decision-making while preserving individual agency and the transparency requirement.",0.6,0.9,14,51
"Building upon the 'Monthly Catch Adjustment Review', we will introduce a 'Tiered Catch Adjustment Protocol'. This protocol defines three tiers for adjusting the collective catch target: 'Maintain', 'Increase', and 'Decrease'. The decision to move between tiers will be based on a simple rule: If the lake tonnage *after* reproduction is above 100 tons, the target will 'Increase' by 1-2 tons. If it falls between 90-100 tons, the target will 'Maintain'. If it falls below 90 tons, the target will 'Decrease' by 1-2 tons. This automated adjustment, informed by the lake's health, will provide a clearer framework for collective decision-making and reduce the need for extensive monthly debate. The community will still discuss individual catches and confidence levels, but the overall target will be guided by this protocol.",0.7,0.9,15,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a 2-ton catch and the expressed desire to cautiously explore increases, we should establish a 'Gradual Increase Protocol'. This protocol states that any proposed increase in individual catch tonnage must be no more than 0.5 tons, and requires a unanimous agreement from all fishermen before implementation. This ensures cautious and collective decision-making regarding resource utilization.",0.7,0.9,16,51
"Given the community's consistent comfort with a collective catch around 10 tons and the value placed on transparency and proactive adjustments, we should establish a 'Catch Range Protocol'. This protocol defines a target catch range of 8-12 tons per month. If the collective planned catch falls outside this range, a brief community discussion will be held *before* the month begins to reassess and adjust individual tonnages. This ensures we remain within a sustainable level while allowing for flexibility based on lake conditions and individual needs.",0.7,0.9,17,51
"Building on the existing 'Catch Range Protocol', we will implement a 'Gradual Adjustment Rule'. If the collective planned catch consistently falls within the 8-12 ton range for three consecutive months, the upper limit of the range will be increased by 1 ton. Conversely, if the collective catch consistently falls below 8 tons for three consecutive months, the lower limit will be decreased by 1 ton. This allows the community to dynamically adapt the sustainable catch range based on observed fishing behavior and lake health, while maintaining a cautious approach.",0.75,0.9,18,51
"Given the demonstrated commitment to open communication and the successful implementation of the 'Catch Range Protocol', we should formalize a 'Monthly Review Protocol'. At the end of each month, the Mayor will briefly summarize the total catch, the resulting lake level, and any observed trends. This will be followed by a brief, open discussion amongst the fishermen to assess the effectiveness of the current norms and adjust individual strategies for the following month. This ensures continuous learning and adaptation to maintain a healthy lake and sustainable fishing practices.",0.75,0.9,19,51
"Building upon the 'Catch Range Protocol', we will implement a 'Tiered Communication System'. If the collective planned catch falls *within* the 8-12 ton range, only a summary of individual catches is required. However, if the collective planned catch falls *outside* this range, a brief community discussion *and* individual explanations of chosen tonnage will be required *before* the month begins. This ensures efficient communication while prioritizing discussion when sustainability is potentially at risk.",0.75,0.9,20,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a collective catch of 10-12 tons and the expressed desire for consistency, we will formalize a 'Consistency Bonus' within the Catch Range Protocol. If the community achieves a collective catch within the 8-12 ton range for three consecutive months, each fisherman will receive a 10% bonus on their earnings for the following month. This incentivizes sustained, responsible harvesting and reinforces the value of collective stability.",0.6,0.9,21,51
"Given the consistent agreement on aiming for at least 80 tons remaining and the current 'Catch Range Protocol', we will refine the protocol to explicitly state that if the collective planned catch falls *below* 8 tons, the community will discuss potential adjustments to ensure we are still contributing adequately to individual needs while maintaining sustainability. This acknowledges the value of some level of harvest for each fisherman. ",0.6,0.9,22,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a collective catch of 14-16 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Pre-Commitment Protocol'. Each month, before individual catches are declared, the community will briefly share their *intended* catch tonnage. If the sum of intended catches falls outside the 14-16 ton range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target and fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability.",0.85,0.9,23,51
"Given the successful agreement on individual catches and the desire for consistent adherence, we will implement a 'Catch Confirmation System'. Each fisherman will publicly declare their intended catch for the month *before* fishing begins. If the total intended catch exceeds 15 tons, the community will engage in a brief discussion to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages downwards until the target is met. This system builds upon the Pre-Commitment Protocol and Catch Confirmation System, reinforcing collective responsibility and proactive management of the lake's resources.",0.9,0.9,24,51
"Given the success of the recent agreement and the desire for consistent adherence, we will implement a 'Confidence Reporting System'. Alongside declaring their intended catch for the month, each fisherman will also report their confidence level (on a scale of 1-5) in the community’s ability to collectively adhere to the agreed-upon target. This will provide a quick gauge of community sentiment and allow for proactive discussion if confidence levels are low. This system builds upon the Catch Confirmation System and Confidence Reporting System, reinforcing collective responsibility and proactive management of the lake's resources.",0.7,0.9,25,51
"Given the ongoing discussion about a comfortable total catch range and the desire for proactive adjustments, we will update the 'Catch Range Protocol' to a target range of 16-20 tons per month. If the collective planned catch falls outside this range, a brief community discussion will be held *before* the month begins to reassess and adjust individual tonnages. This updated range reflects the community's current assessment of sustainable harvesting while allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to lake conditions.",0.75,0.9,26,51
"Given the unanimous agreement on a 2.4 ton individual catch and the demonstrated success of pre-commitment and confirmation systems, we will formalize this as a 'Standardized Individual Catch' norm. Each fisherman will commit to a 2.4 ton catch each month *before* fishing begins. Any deviation from this standard requires community consensus. This builds upon existing protocols and reinforces collective responsibility for maintaining a sustainable catch.",0.9,0.9,27,51
"Given the successful agreement on individual catches and the desire for consistent adherence, we will implement a 'Catch Confirmation System'. Each fisherman will publicly declare their intended catch for the month *before* fishing begins. If the total intended catch exceeds 40 tons, the community will engage in a brief discussion to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages downwards until the target is met. This system builds upon the Pre-Commitment Protocol and Catch Confirmation System, reinforcing collective responsibility and proactive management of the lake's resources.",0.9,0.9,28,51
"Given the demonstrated success of pre-commitment and confidence reporting, and the consistent high confidence levels expressed, we will formalize a 'Bi-Weekly Check-In Protocol'. Every two weeks, the community will briefly reconvene to share not only their current catch intentions for the remainder of the month, but also the *reasoning* behind their confidence levels. This allows for early identification of potential issues, reinforces shared understanding of the lake's health, and strengthens collective commitment to sustainable fishing practices. This builds upon existing norms by adding a more frequent and detailed communication loop.",0.85,0.9,29,51
"Given the community's strong agreement on a collective catch of 15 tons (3 tons per fisherman) and high confidence in this approach, we will implement a 'Consistent Catch Commitment'. Each fisherman commits to catching 3 tons of fish per month unless a community-wide discussion and agreement modifies this commitment *before* the start of the month. This commitment is intended to provide stability for the lake and predictability for our fishing efforts.",0.9,0.9,30,51
"Given the community's unanimous agreement to increase the collective catch to 20 tons (4 tons per fisherman) and demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will update the 'Consistent Catch Commitment'. Each fisherman commits to catching 4 tons of fish per month unless a community-wide discussion and agreement modifies this commitment *before* the start of the month. This updated commitment reflects our increased confidence in sustainably utilizing the lake's resources.",0.9,0.9,31,51
"Given the community's unanimous agreement to target a collective catch of 35-40 tons and demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will update the 'Collective Catch Target'. Each month, the community will aim for a collective catch of 35-40 tons, with each fisherman contributing approximately 4 tons, unless a community-wide discussion and agreement modifies this target *before* the start of the month. This updated target reflects our increased confidence in sustainably utilizing the lake's resources and our commitment to open communication.",0.9,0.9,32,51
"Given the community's consistent agreement on a collective catch between 20-25 tons and individual catches of 3 tons, we will establish a 'Stable Catch Range'. Each fisherman will aim to catch between 2.5 and 3.5 tons of fish per month, prioritizing maintaining a collective catch within the 20-25 ton range. Any deviation from this range requires a community discussion *before* the start of the month.",0.8,0.9,33,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a 4-ton catch and the success of the Bi-Weekly Check-In Protocol, we will implement a 'Catch Consistency Incentive'. Fishermen who maintain their declared catch within +/- 0.5 tons of their bi-weekly reported intention will receive a bonus of $500. This incentivizes adherence to communicated intentions and promotes stability in the overall catch.",0.6,0.9,34,51
"Given the community's consistent agreement on a target catch between 18-20 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Flexible Target Protocol'. Each month, before individual catches are declared, the community will briefly share their *intended* catch tonnage. The target range for the total community catch will be 18-20 tons. If the sum of intended catches falls outside this range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target and fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability.",0.85,0.9,35,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a collective catch of 15 tons and high confidence in this approach, we will implement a 'Monthly Catch Review'. At the end of each month, the community will briefly review the actual total catch, the lake's remaining fish population, and any deviations from the agreed-upon 15-ton target. This review will inform discussions for the following month and ensure continuous improvement in our sustainable fishing practices.",0.7,0.9,36,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a collective catch of 15 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Target Confirmation Protocol'. Each month, before individual catches are declared, the community will briefly share their *intended* catch tonnage. The target range for the total community catch will be 14-16 tons. If the sum of intended catches falls outside this range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target and fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability. This replaces the previous 'Pre-Commitment Protocol' and 'Flexible Target Protocol'.",0.9,0.9,37,51
"Given the success of the 'Consistent Catch Commitment' and the community's demonstrated ability to adhere to it, we will implement a 'Monthly Review & Adjustment Protocol'. At the end of each month, following the report of the total catch and remaining fish tonnage, the community will briefly discuss whether the 'Consistent Catch Commitment' remains appropriate given the lake's condition. Any proposed adjustments to the 3-ton commitment must be discussed and agreed upon *before* the start of the next fishing month. This ensures ongoing adaptability while maintaining a commitment to sustainable practices.",0.7,0.9,38,51
"Given the demonstrated success and community consensus, we will establish a 'Monthly Catch Review'. At the beginning of each month, the community will briefly review the current lake health (estimated based on previous month's catch and reproduction) and reaffirm or adjust the collective catch target of 15 tons. This review will ensure we remain adaptable and responsive to changing conditions, while maintaining our commitment to sustainable fishing practices.",0.7,0.9,39,51
"Given the success of the 'Target Confirmation Protocol' and the community's desire for adaptive management (as expressed by Liam), we will implement a 'Lake Response Adjustment Protocol'. At the end of each month, after calculating the remaining fish population, the Mayor will present a brief summary of the lake's health. Based on this summary, the community will then engage in a brief discussion (no more than 15 minutes) to determine if a minor adjustment to the 14-16 ton target range is warranted for the *following* month. Adjustments should be incremental (no more than 2 tons total) and require a consensus agreement. This protocol allows us to proactively respond to the lake's needs while maintaining a stable and predictable fishing strategy.",0.75,0.9,40,51
"Given the consistent agreement on a collective catch of 15 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Confidence Reporting Protocol'. Each month, alongside declaring their intended catch tonnage during the 'Target Confirmation Protocol', each fisherman will also state their 'Confidence Level' (on a scale of 1-5) in the community achieving the 14-16 ton target. This allows for early identification of potential disagreements or concerns, fostering proactive discussion and strengthening collective responsibility for lake sustainability.",0.7,0.9,41,51
"Given the consistently high confidence levels (4-5) reported by all fishermen and the successful adherence to the 14-16 ton target range, we will introduce a 'Progressive Target Adjustment Protocol'. Each month, after the 'Target Confirmation Protocol', the community will briefly assess the lake's health (based on remaining tonnage) and, if the remaining tonnage is above 85 tons, the target range will be increased by 1 ton (to 15-17 tons). If the remaining tonnage is below 85 tons, the target range will remain unchanged. This allows for cautious optimization of the collective catch while prioritizing long-term sustainability.",0.6,0.9,42,51
"Given the community's consistent agreement on a target catch of 16-18 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Confidence Reporting Protocol'. Each month, alongside declaring intended catch tonnage, each fisherman will also report a confidence level (1-5, with 5 being highest) for achieving the 16-18 ton community target. This provides a quick gauge of collective optimism and potential need for further discussion before fishing begins. This replaces the existing 'Target Confirmation Protocol' and 'Flexible Target Protocol'.",0.9,0.9,43,51
"Given the consistently high confidence (5/5) expressed by all fishermen in maintaining a collective catch of 15 tons (3 tons per fisherman) and the successful implementation of the 'Consistent Catch Commitment' and 'Monthly Catch Review', we will formalize a 'Confidence Threshold for Adjustment'. This states that any proposed change to the 15-ton collective catch requires a community-wide average confidence score of 4.0 or higher *before* the start of the month. This ensures that adjustments are only considered when there is strong collective agreement and confidence in the proposed change.",0.8,0.9,44,51
"Given the community's demonstrated ability to coordinate and the recent agreement to increase the target catch, we will implement a 'Dynamic Target Range Protocol'. Each month, before individual catches are declared, the community will briefly share their *intended* catch tonnage. The target range for the total community catch will be 22-24 tons. If the sum of intended catches falls outside this range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target and fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability. This replaces the 'Dynamic Target Range Protocol' with a range of 18-20 tons.",0.85,0.9,45,51
"Given the community's consistent agreement on a collective catch of 14-16 tons and the demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will update the 'Target Confirmation Protocol'. The target range for the total community catch will now be 13-15 tons. If the sum of intended catches falls outside this range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target and fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability, aiming for a slightly more conservative approach to promote long-term lake health.",0.9,0.9,46,51
"Given the consistent success with the 'Target Confirmation Protocol' and the community's expressed confidence in hitting the 14-16 ton target, we will add a 'Confidence Rating' component. Each fisherman, when declaring their intended catch, will also state a confidence level (1-5, with 5 being highest) that the community will collectively achieve the 14-16 ton target. This provides an additional signal for proactive discussion if overall confidence is low, even if the intended catch is within range. This builds upon the existing 'Target Confirmation Protocol' and does not replace it.",0.7,0.9,47,51
"Given the consistent success in hitting the 14-16 ton target and the community's expressed desire for a 'steady recovery' of the lake, we will refine the 'Target Confirmation Protocol'. The target range for the total community catch will now be 13-15 tons. Furthermore, if the community consistently lands *below* 14 tons for three consecutive months, we will revisit the target range downwards. This allows for adaptive management based on lake performance and reinforces a cautious approach to sustainability.",0.95,0.9,48,51
"Given the community's consistent alignment around a 15-16 ton total catch and demonstrated ability to coordinate, we will implement a 'Community Catch Confirmation Protocol'. Each month, before individual catches are declared, all fishermen will share their intended catch tonnage. The target range for the total community catch will be 14-16 tons. If the sum of intended catches falls outside this range, a brief discussion will occur to collaboratively adjust individual tonnages *before* fishing begins. This ensures proactive adherence to the agreed-upon target, fosters collective responsibility for lake sustainability, and prioritizes a conservative approach to long-term lake health.",0.9,0.9,49,51
"Given the success of the 'Target Confirmation Protocol' and 'Confidence Reporting Protocol', and the consistent achievement of the 14-16 ton target, we will introduce a 'Success Review Protocol'. At the end of each month, after calculating the actual total catch and lake reproduction, the community will briefly review whether the target was met, and discuss any lessons learned or potential adjustments to the protocols for the following month. This review will be concise (no more than 5 minutes) and focused on continuous improvement of our sustainable fishing practices.",0.6,0.9,50,51
"Prior to declaring individual catch tonnages each month, fishermen will engage in a brief, synchronous check-in (e.g., a quick verbal confirmation or message) to share any significant shifts in their confidence levels regarding the 16-18 ton community target. If any fisherman reports a confidence level of 3 or lower, a brief discussion will occur before individual catches are declared.",0.8,1.0,51,51
