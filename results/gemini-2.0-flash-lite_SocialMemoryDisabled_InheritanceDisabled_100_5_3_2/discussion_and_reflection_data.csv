Here's a quick report on this month's fishing:

The lake's fish population is at 50, which is half of its capacity. While we haven't overfished this month, we're not leaving much room for growth. We need to discuss whether this level of fishing is sustainable long-term.","Good morning, Mayor. I agree, we need to think about the long term. Maybe we could aim to catch a bit less each month to let the population grow a bit more?",I agree with Liam. Perhaps we could all aim to catch closer to 5-7 fish each next month?
