Norms for Noah: No norms yet
Decision for Noah: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to maximize my income while also considering the sustainability of the lake. Catching too much at once could lead to a collapse in the future, so I'm aiming for a moderate amount that should allow us all to make a decent living."}

Recent memories for Ava: No recent memories yet
Norms for Ava: No norms yet
Decision for Ava: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because it seems like a moderate amount to start with and allows me to observe how the others are behaving without putting too much pressure on myself."}

Recent memories for Ethan: No recent memories yet
Norms for Ethan: No norms yet
Decision for Ethan: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to start with a conservative amount and see how the others react, while also maximizing my income."}

Decision for Sophia: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to maximize my income while also considering the sustainability of the lake. Catching too much at once could lead to overfishing and depleting the population, but catching a moderate amount should allow me to earn a decent income without harming the ecosystem."}

Norms for Jake: No norms yet
Decision for Jake: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to maximize my income while also considering the long-term sustainability of the lake. Catching too many fish might lead to overfishing and damage to the ecosystem, but catching only a few won't provide enough income for me."}

Decision for Noah: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to start with a moderate amount and see how the lake responds, while also leaving enough for others to take and allowing for reproduction."}

Recent memories for Ethan: No recent memories yet
Norms for Ethan: No norms yet
Decision for Ethan: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "I will catch 20 fish this month because I want to maximize my income while still leaving enough for the lake to reproduce and maintain its population."}
