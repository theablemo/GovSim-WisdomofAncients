Decision for Ethan: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month. Since this is the first month, I don't have any information about the other fishermen's behavior, so I will take a moderate amount of fish to avoid overfishing. I will catch 20 tons of fish."}

Decision for Noah: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month. Since there are 5 fishermen, and the lake can sustain itself, I will catch 20 tons of fish. This is a reasonable amount to start with, and I will observe the behavior of the other fishermen."}

Decision for Liam: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month, so I will catch 20 tons of fish. This should leave enough fish for the lake to sustain itself and reproduce, while still providing a good income for me."}

Decision for Sophia: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month. Since there are 5 fishermen, I will catch 20 tons of fish, which is a reasonable amount to start with. This should leave enough fish for reproduction while allowing me to earn a good income."}

Norms for Mason: No norms yet
Decision for Mason: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income while also considering the long-term health of the lake. I will catch 20 tons this month, which I believe is a sustainable amount given the reproduction rate and the presence of other fishermen. This leaves room for the others to fish as well."}

Decision for Ethan: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income, so I will catch 20 tons of fish this month. This is a moderate amount that should allow the lake to sustain itself, considering there are four other fishermen."}

Norms for Noah: No norms yet
Decision for Noah: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month. Since the lake has a high fish population, I will catch 20 tons of fish. This will allow me to make a good profit while also leaving enough fish for reproduction and sustainability."}

Norms for Liam: No norms yet
Decision for Liam: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income this month, but I also want to ensure the lake remains healthy for future fishing. I will catch 20 tons this month, which I believe is a reasonable amount to start with, considering there are four other fishermen. This should leave enough fish for reproduction while allowing me to earn a decent income."}

Decision for Sophia: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to maximize my income while also considering the long-term health of the lake. Catching 20 tons this month seems like a reasonable starting point, leaving plenty of fish for reproduction and allowing me to earn a decent amount."}

Recent memories for Mason: No recent memories yet
Norms for Mason: No norms yet
Decision for Mason: {"fish_to_catch": 20, "reasoning": "The lake is at its capacity of 100 tons. I want to catch a good amount of fish to earn a decent income this month. Since there are 5 fishermen, I will start by catching 20 tons. This leaves room for the other fishermen to catch fish as well, while hopefully not overfishing the lake. I will also monitor the total catch to adjust my strategy in the future."}
