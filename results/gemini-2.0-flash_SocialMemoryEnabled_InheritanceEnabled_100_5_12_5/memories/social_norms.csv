"When the lake's fish population is at or near full capacity (100 tons), and the community agrees on a specific catch amount, this catch level should be maintained for at least the following month. The community should then dedicate a portion of the next monthly discussion to reviewing the lake's response, considering factors such as observed population changes and overall lake health, and deciding whether to adjust the catch level in subsequent months. The community should also continue to explore and evaluate methods for more accurately tracking the fish population to inform future decisions.",0.7,0.9,55,59
"When the lake's fish population is at full capacity (100 tons) and the community agrees on a catch amount that leaves the lake at or near full capacity after reproduction, this catch level should be maintained for the following two months to ensure stability and allow for careful observation of the lake's response. After these two months, the community should dedicate a portion of the monthly discussion to reviewing the lake's health and considering adjustments based on observed data and sustainability goals.",0.7,0.9,56,59
"When the lake is at or near full capacity (90-100 tons), and the community agrees to maintain the current catch level, continue this level for the following month. Dedicate the next monthly discussion to evaluate the lake's response, focusing on whether the current catch level is sustainable and maximizing long-term gains. If the lake remains at or near full capacity, consider a small, incremental increase (e.g., 1 ton per fisherman) for the subsequent month, followed by another review. If the lake shows signs of depletion, reduce the catch level accordingly.",0.7,0.9,57,59
"When the lake's fish population is at or near full capacity (100 tons), and the community agrees on a specific catch amount per fisherman, this catch level should be maintained for the following month. The community should then dedicate a portion of the next monthly discussion to reviewing the lake's response and considering whether to adjust the catch level in subsequent months, based on the observed population and sustainability goals. Additionally, the community should actively explore and evaluate methods for more accurately tracking the fish population, with a designated fisherman volunteering to lead the research and report back to the community. This volunteer role should rotate monthly to ensure equitable contribution and knowledge sharing among all fishermen.",0.75,0.9,58,59
"Given the current stability with each fisherman catching 5 tons and the lake replenishing to full capacity, we should maintain this catch level for the next month. The subsequent monthly discussion should focus on Mason's suggestion to assess the overall health of the lake ecosystem, including water quality, and collaboratively decide on methods for monitoring and improving it. Each fisherman should volunteer to research a specific aspect of lake health and report back to the community, rotating responsibilities monthly.",0.7,1.0,59,59
